Getting started
===============

Druplash is a MVC framework for Drupal. It is actually an adaptation of [Mouf's Splash MVC framework](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/mvc.splash).
If you have a project developed with Splash, you can completely reuse your code, right into a Drupal installation.  

To get started, you first need to set up your environment.

Install
-------

```sh
composer require mouf/integration.drupal.druplash ^8.0
 ```

Your packages are downloaded? Have a quick look at the [installation guide](doc/install.md).

Then, check the tutorial and learn how to [create a controller](doc/tutorial.md), right inside your Drupal website!
